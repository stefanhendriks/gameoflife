Conway's Game Of Life
=====================

Conway's Game of Life is a simulation where a generation of 'cells' either survives or dies by the following simple rules:

An alive cell:
- dies with less than 2 neighbours
- survives with exactly 2 or 3 neighbours
- dies with more than 3 neighbours

A not-alive cell:
- revives with exactly 3 neighbours

That's it.
